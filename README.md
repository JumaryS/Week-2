* Day 0:


Websites by using css and html
Css: style
HTML: format
* Day 1:

1. JS: functions
2. JS is a high level scripting language
We learned that Java Script is the same as Java

3. Booleans: is a datatype that returns either of two values i.e. true or false. In JavaScript, boolean is used as a function to get the value of a variable, object, conditions, expressions etc. in terms of true or false.


4. NaN: not a number

5. Null:'Null' is a keyword in JavaScript that signifies 'no value' or nonexistence of any value. If you wish to shred a variable off its assigned value, you can simply assign 'null' to it. Besides this, like any other object, it is never implicitly assigned to a variable by JavaScript.

6. Undefine: assigns 'undefined' to any object that has been declared but not initialized or defined. In other words, in a case where no value has been explicitly assigned to the variable, JavaScript calls it 'undefined'. 2. Array index or object property that does not exist.

7.  Let:  let allows you to declare variables that are limited to a scope of a block statement, or expression on which it is used, unlike the var keyword, which defines a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.
# did some research 

            1. Const: The difference in const variable declaration than others is that it cannot be reassigned. Properties: ... The values inside the const array can be change, it can add new items to const arrays but it cannot reference to a new array.
   
            2. Console.log:The console. log() is a function in JavaScript which is used to print any kind of variables defined before in it or to just print any message that needs to be displayed to the user. Syntax: console.

            3.JavaScript Remainder / Modulus (%)The remainder / modulus operator ( % ) returns the remainder after (integer) division. This operator returns the remainder left over when one operand is divided by a second operand


* Day 2-3

1. Functions using math operators 
2. " - " = minus
3. " + " = plus
4. " = " = equals
5. " / " = divide by
6. " % " = modulus or how many times a num can go into another num
   
￼

1. Reassign variable: call back the variable place an equal sign and the new assignment

* Example: let num = 5

To change the value of num call the variable (num) place an equal sign and then new value

* Example: num = 7 now num equals 7 


1. Functions: A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

Scope:

Red lines under a code means its incorrect 
Blue line under code means a typo



1. Keyword short cut:

Option shift 

Select the word you want (that has multiple copies) Command shift L to select all of the same words

# Day 4

1. Strings: A string is a sequence of one or more characters that may consist of letters, numbers, or symbols. Strings in JavaScript are primitive data types and immutable, which means they are unchanging.

2. Return values: "The return statement stops the execution of a function and returns a value from that function. ... Start with the introduction chapter about JavaScript Functions and JavaScript Scope. For more detailed information, see our Function Section on Function Definitions, Parameters, Invocation and Closures."

3. Parameters: are variables listed as a part of the function definition.

# We learned about Quokka:

 You can go back and change your code
Quokka  shows you your error and finishes your sentences
